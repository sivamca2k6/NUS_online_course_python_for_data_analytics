    "## Case Study: A Newsvendor Problem\n",
    "***Background***: The newsvendor model is a mathematical model in operations management and applied economics used to determine optimal inventory levels. It is typically characterized by fixed prices and uncertain demand for a number of perishable products. In this case study, we adopt the classic problem setting with two products: a newsboy is selling two types of newspapers, <code>paper1</code>, and <code>paper2</code>. The future demands of newspapers are affected by weather conditions. The demands under different weather conditions, as well as the probability associated with each weather condition, are provided in the following table. \n",
