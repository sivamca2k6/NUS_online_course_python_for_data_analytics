    "You may find that the \"Cheerleader\" program we discussed in the live session is not yet perfect. One of the most significant flaws is that it gives wrong articles for some of the letters. For example, the correct sentence should be \"Give me an I\", but the program would print \"Give me a I\". We, therefore, want to correct this mistake in the updated version of the \"Cheerleader\" program. Another change is to use upper case when each letter is shouted out. Write a program to incorporate these two changes in the \"Cheerleader\" program. A sample output is given below."
